    - Fix tests for 5.18 by making sure expansions
      are sorted, and making sure we don't clobber
      @_ with an implicit split to @_ in
      _expand_spf_component.

    - Make sure we can run the script on
      the same zonefile again without
      creating nonsense.
    - Fix tests by not reading from the file,
      but using a new return scalar value
      from ->write. It used to return 1, now
      it returns the string that will be
      written out.

0.005 2013-07-28

      contain the protocol, v=spf1.
