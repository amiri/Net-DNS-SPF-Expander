=head1 NAME

Net::DNS::SPF::Expander

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module expands DNS SPF records, so you don't have to.
The problem is that you only get 10 per SPF record,
and recursions count against you. Your record won't
validate.

Let's say you start with this as an SPF record:

    @   TXT   "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net a:hq1.campusexplorer.com a:hq2.campusexplorer.com a:mail2.campusexplorer.com ~all"

You go to http://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html and check this record.
It passes validation. But later you come back and add salesforce, so that you
now have:

    @   TXT   "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net include:salesforce.com a:hq1.campusexplorer.com a:hq2.campusexplorer.com a:mail2.campusexplorer.com ~all"

And now your record fails validation.

    _spf.google.com takes 3 lookups.
        _spf1.google.com
        _spf2.google.com
        _spf3.google.com
    sendgrid.net takes 1 lookup.
        _sendgrid.biz
    hq1 takes 1 lookup.
    hq2 takes 1 lookup.
    mail2 takes 1 lookup.

Salesforce adds:

    _spf.google.com (3 you already did)
        _spf1.google.com
        _spf2.google.com
        _spf3.google.com
    mx takes 4 lookups.
        salesforce.com.s8a1.psmtp.com.
        salesforce.com.s8a2.psmtp.com.
        salesforce.com.s8b1.psmtp.com.
        salesforce.com.s8b2.psmtp.com.

So now instead of 7 you have 14. The common advice is to
expand them, and that is a tedious process. It's especially
tedious when, say, salesforce changes their mx record.

So this module and the accompanying script attempt
to automate this process for you.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Using the script:

    myhost:~/ $ dns-dpf-expander --input_file zone.db
    myhost:~/ $ ls
     zone.db   zone.db.new   zone.db.bak

Using the module:

    {
        package MyDNSExpander;

        use Net::DNS::SPF::Expander;

        my $input_file = '/home/me/project/etc/zone.db';
        my $expander = Net::DNS::SPF::Expander->new(
            input_file => $input_file
        );

        my $string = $expander->write;

        1;
    }

=head1 CONFIGURABLE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 input_file

This is the path and name of the zonefile whose SPF records you want
to expand. It must be a valid L<Net::DNS::Zonefile> zonefile.

=cut

has 'input_file' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'Str',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 output_file

The path and name of the output file. By default, we tack ".new"
onto the end of the original filename.

=cut

has 'output_file' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Str',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build_output_file',
);

The path and name of the backup file. By default, we tack ".bak"
onto the end of the original filename.

=cut

has 'backup_file' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => IO_All,
    lazy       => 1,
    coerce     => 1,
    builder    => '_build_backup_file',
);

=head2 nameservers

A list of nameservers that will be passed to the resolver.

=cut

has 'nameservers' => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => 'Maybe[ArrayRef]',
);

=head2 parsed_file

The L<Net::DNS::Zonefile> object created from the input_file.

=cut

has 'parsed_file' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Net::DNS::ZoneFile',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build_parsed_file',
);

=head2 to_expand

An arrayref of regexes that we will expand. By default we expand
a, mx, include, and redirect records. Configurable.

=cut

has 'to_expand' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'ArrayRef[RegexpRef]',
    default => sub {
        [ qr/^a:/, qr/^mx/, qr/^include/, qr/^redirect/, ];
    },
);

=head2 to_copy

An arrayref of regexes that we will simply copy over. By default
we will copy ip4, ip6, ptr, and exists records. Configurable.

=cut

has 'to_copy' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'ArrayRef[RegexpRef]',
    default => sub {
        [ qr/v=spf1/, qr/^ip4/, qr/^ip6/, qr/^ptr/, qr/^exists/, ];
    },
);

=head2 to_ignore

An arrayref of regexes that we will ignore. By default we ignore ?all,
exp, v=spf1, and ~all.

=cut

has 'to_ignore' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'ArrayRef[RegexpRef]',
    default => sub {
        [ qr/^v=spf1/, qr/^(\??)all/, qr/^exp/, qr/^~all/ ];
    },
);

=head2 maximum_record_length

We leave out the protocol declaration and the trailing ~all
while we are expanding records, so we need to subtract their length
from our length calculation.

=cut

has 'maximum_record_length' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Int',
    default => sub {
        255 - length('v=spf1 ') - length(' ~all') - length('"') - length('"');
    },
);

=head2 ttl

Default time to live is 10 minutes. Configurable.

=cut

has 'ttl' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Str',
    default => sub {
        '10M',;
    },
);

=head2 origin

The origin of the zonefile. We take it from the zonefile,
or you can set it if you like.

=cut

has 'origin' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Str',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build_origin',
);

=head1 PRIVATE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 _input_file

The L<IO::All> object created from the input_file.

=cut

has '_input_file' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => IO_All,
    coerce     => 1,
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build__input_file',
);

=head2 _resource_records

An arrayref of all the L<Net::DNS::RR> resource records
found in the entire parsed_file.

=cut

has '_resource_records' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Maybe[ArrayRef[Net::DNS::RR]]',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build__resource_records',
);

=head2 _spf_records

An arrayref of the L<Net::DNS::RR::TXT> or L<Net::DNS::RR::SPF>
records found in the entire parsed_file.

=cut

has '_spf_records' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Maybe[ArrayRef[Net::DNS::RR]]',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build__spf_records',
);

=head2 _resolver

What we use to do the DNS lookups and expand the records. A
L<Net::DNS::Resolver> object. You can still set environment
variables if you want to change the nameserver it uses.

=cut

has '_resolver' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Net::DNS::Resolver',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build__resolver',
);

=head2 _expansions

This is a hashref representing the expanded SPF records. The keys
are the names of the SPF records, and the values are hashrefs.
Those are keyed on the include, and the values are arrayrefs of the
expanded values. There is also a key called "elements" which gathers
all the includes into one place, e.g.,

    "*.test_zone.com" => {
        "~all"   => undef,
        elements => [
            "ip4:216.239.32.0/19", "ip4:64.233.160.0/19",
            "ip4:66.249.80.0/20",  "ip4:72.14.192.0/18",
            ...
        ],
        "include:_spf.google.com" => [
             "ip4:216.239.32.0/19",
             "ip4:64.233.160.0/19",
             ...
        ],
        "ip4:96.43.144.0/20" => [ "ip4:96.43.144.0/20" ],
        "v=spf1"             => undef
      }

They are alpha sorted in the final results for predictability in tests.

=cut

has '_expansions' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'HashRef',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build__expansions',
);

=head2 _lengths_of_expansions

We need to know how long the expanded record would be, because
SPF records should be less than 256 bytes. If the expanded
record would be longer than that, we need to split it into
pieces.

=cut

has '_lengths_of_expansions' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'HashRef',
    lazy       => 1,
    builder    => '_build__lengths_of_expansions',
);

=head2 _record_class

What sort of records are SPF records? IN records.

=cut

has '_record_class' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Str',
    default => sub {
        'IN',;

=head2 _build_origin

Extract the origin from parsed_file.

=cut

}

=head2 _build_expansions

=cut

sub _build__expansions {
    my $self = shift;

=head2 _build_backup_file

Tack a ".bak" onto the end of the input_file.

    my $name = $self->_input_file->filename;
    return "${path}${name}.bak";
}

=head2 _build__input_file

Turn the string input_file into a filehandle with
L<IO::All>.

=cut

sub _build__input_file {
    my $self = shift;
    return to_IO_All( $self->input_file );

}

=head2 _build_parsed_file

Turn the L<IO::All> filehandle into a L<Net::DNS::Zonefile>
object, so that we can extract the SPF records.

=cut

sub _build_parsed_file {
    my $self = shift;
    my $path = $self->_input_file->filepath;
    my $name = $self->_input_file->filename;

    return \@resource_records;
}

=head2 _build__spf_records

Grep through the _resource_records to find the SPF
records. They can be both "TXT" and "SPF" records,
so we search for the protocol string, v=spf1.

=cut

    my $self = shift;

    # This is crude but correct: SPF records can be both TXT and SPF.
    my @spf_records =

    @{ $self->_resource_records };
    return \@spf_records;
}

=head2 _build__lengths_of_expansions

Calculate the length of each fully expanded SPF record,
because they can't be longer than 256 bytes. We have to split them
up into multiple records if they are.

=head2 _normalize_component

Each component of an SPF record has a prefix, like include:, mx:, etc.
Here we chop off the prefix before performing the lookup on the value.

Expand a single SPF record component. This returns either undef or the
full SPF record string from L<Net::DNS::RR::TXT>->txtdata.

=head2 _expand_spf_component

Recursively call _perform_expansion for each component of the SPF record.
This returns an array consisting of the component, e.g., include:salesforce.com,
and an arrayref consisting of its full expansion, e.g.,

    [

=head2 _new_records_from_partition

The full expansion of a given SPF record is contained in an arrayref,
and if the length of the resulting new SPF record would be greater than the
maximum_record_length, we have to jump through some hoops to properly split
it into new SPF records. Because there will be more than one, and each needs
to be less than the maximum_record_length. We do our partitioning here, and
then call _new_records_from_arrayref on each of the resulting partitions.

the symbols. This code replaces the fully qualified record names with symbols.

=head2 _get_multiple_record_strings

Whereas a single new SPF record needs to be concatenated from
the stringified L<Net::DNS::RR::TXT>s, and have the trailing
~all added, multiple new SPF records do not need that. They need to be given
special _spf names that will then be included in "master" SPF records, and
they don't need the trailing ~all.
